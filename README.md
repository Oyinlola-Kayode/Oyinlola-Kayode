# 👋 Hi, i’m @oyinlola kayode

👀 I’m interested in data analysis, data visualization, and turning data into meaningful business insights.

🌱 I work with tools like excel, power bi, sql, and python (pandas, numpy) to clean, analyze, and visualize data for decision-making.

💼 I have experience analyzing large datasets, building interactive dashboards, and delivering insights that solve real-world business problems.

💞️ I’m open to collaborating on data analysis projects, visual storytelling, and anything that makes data more understandable and impactful.
