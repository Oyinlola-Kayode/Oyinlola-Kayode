## 👩‍💻 About Me  

I am a passionate **Data Analyst** with a background in **Biochemistry**, driven by a strong desire to uncover insights and deliver data-driven solutions that enhance health outcomes and organizational performance. I enjoy merging analytical thinking with scientific reasoning to solve complex problems and create measurable impact across diverse sectors.  

I’m deeply grounded in **data storytelling** — transforming data into clear, actionable insights that guide decisions and drive meaningful results. My technical toolkit includes **Power BI, SQL, Python, and Zapier**, alongside **Microsoft tools (Excel, PowerPoint, Word)** and **Google Sheets**, which I use to analyze, visualize, and communicate findings effectively.  

Beyond analytics, I value **collaboration, connection, and community impact**. I enjoy engaging with like-minded professionals, volunteering for initiatives that promote growth, and contributing to projects that use data to foster innovation and development in this evolving digital era.  

Curious, adaptable, and purpose-driven, I continuously expand my expertise to remain versatile and impactful — using data not only to inform but to **inspire change and shape progress**.
